Countries Hackacthon 

This was a team hackathon in which we were breifed to call data from an API and create a muiti page app to be able to show data for each coutry on its own page.
The app also has filters to search for a coutry by name of filter by region (The region filter isn't quite functioning fully, yet...).  
For the build we used React and React Router.
